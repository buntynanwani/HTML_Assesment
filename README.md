# 🍔 Food Ordering System - Admin Dashboard (HTML Project)

This project is the first phase of a **Full Stack Development** training exercise.  
It is a static **Admin Dashboard** built using **HTML** to visualize the structure of a Food Ordering System before moving into backend and interactivity.

The Admin Dashboard allows administrators to manage:

- ✅ Food Items  
- ✅ Cuisines  
- ✅ Categories  
- ✅ Restaurants  
- ✅ Orders  
- ✅ User Accounts  

Each section contains pages for **Add** (create) and **List** (view) operations.
